**Do not use this tool for any unauthorized or illegal network attacks. I take no responsibility for any misuse or illegal activities conducted with this tool.**
<br>
<br>
A tool created for recreational purposes. It has been tested and proven to bypass antivirus software such as McAfee, Avira, 360safe, and others. In addition to static evasion techniques, it also supports dynamic evasion. The core functionality of the tool relies on shellcode injection technology.
It is recommended to refactor the open-source tool to remove certain fingerprints and increase the probability of bypassing antivirus (AV) software. Of course, this tool will be further modified to evade AV detection once again.
The code might not be aesthetically pleasing, and there are currently no plans for open-sourcing or updating it. However, I assure you that there are no backdoors in the code.

**Help**

```
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  filename,Files to be loaded.
```

**Steps for usage**

1.Generate payload using Admin side,Take mimikatz as an example below.

Note:exeNmae is the software name of the executable file to be used, no suffix is required. Only effective for exe format files.

After execution, two files will be generated: one is the shellcode file (mimikatz.txt) and the other is the attack payload (mimikatz_Payload.txt).

```
BlackCat-Admin_v1.2.exe -f exeName
Example:BlackCat-Admin_v1.2.exe -f mimikatz
```

2.Rename Payload

```
ren exeName_Payload.txt Payload.txt
Example:ren mimikatz_Payload.txt Payload.txt
```

3.Upload the loader to the target server to load the tool and execute the command.

You need to upload three files, BlackCat-Agent.exe, exeName.txt, and payload.txt, to the target server.

Remote loading is currently not available. Only local loading solutions are provided.

```
BlackCat-Agent_v1.2.exe exeName.txt  cmd
Example:BlackCat-Agent_v1.2.exe mimikatz.txt "privilege::debug" "sekurlsa::logonpasswords" exit
```

The difference between BlackCat-AgentCs_v1.2.exe and BlackCat-Agent_v1.2.exe lies in their user interface. BlackCat-AgentCs does not display a terminal or graphical interface, making it suitable for scenarios like Cobalt Strike where stealthiness is required. On the other hand, BlackCat-Agent allows you to view the feedback of command execution in the terminal interface.

**已知错误，但目前无法修复。**

运行程序后，所有命令行参数都将传递给执行的工具。 Mimikatz的使用不受影响，并且还可以运行Cobalt Strike客户端。

该工具的最初设计意图是模块化绕过防病毒（AV）软件，但由于这些限制，其使用受到限制。 未来有计划重构代码，改用DLL加载和注入方式。 然而，它仍然是 Cobalt Strike 场景中的一个有用工具。
